/**
 * The starting points offered under the home page composer.
 *
 * The label is what the button says; the prompt is what is actually built. They
 * are deliberately different lengths — a button has room for two words, and the
 * agent needs a brief. So each prompt says what the player does, what it looks
 * like, and how a round ends, because a first turn spent guessing at those is a
 * first turn that produces someone else's game.
 *
 * They stay in the player's voice rather than the agent's: nothing here names
 * a file, an engine primitive, or a three.js class. The system prompt in
 * `@/lib/games/instructions` already covers how a game is built — these only
 * have to settle what to build.
