// `@daytona/sdk` reaches its heavier dependencies through a `require` held in a
// variable — `form-data` for uploads, `tar` and `fast-glob` for downloads and
// image contexts — which esbuild cannot see and so never pulls into the bundle.
// Locally that require still finds them in `node_modules`; a deployed worker has
// no `node_modules`, so the first `fs.uploadFiles` dies on `Cannot find module
// 'form-data'`. Leaving the package out of the bundle and installing it in the
// deployment instead puts a real `node_modules` back under those requires.
//
// `build.external` is the documented way to do that and does not work here: the
// CLI marks a package external only after reading a name out of the nearest
// package.json to the resolved entry point, and for this SDK that is
// `@daytona/sdk/cjs/package.json` — a two-line `{"type": "commonjs"}` with no
// name — so the entry is dropped without a word and the package is bundled
// anyway. Hence the plugin below, which does the same job by hand.
